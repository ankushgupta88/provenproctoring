                            <h3>Is Your Company Ready for the OSHA ETS in 2022?</h3>
                      <p><strong>Did you know that OSHA will begin fining businesses that violate the federal mandate on January 10?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• OSHA announced it would begin fining businesses that violate the federal vaccine mandate on January 10.<br> • There are no plans to fine businesses for COVID-19 testing requirements until at least February 9.<br> • The 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the mandate for businesses with more than 100 employees on 12/17/21.</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Penalties for Violating the ETS COVID-19 Mandate?</strong><br> OSHA may fine a covered employer that does not comply with the ETS up to $13,653 for each violation of the standard. Employers that willfully or repeatedly violate the standard can be fined up to $136,532. However, the Build Back Better Act, if enacted, would raise the maximum fine to $700,000. OSHA also has a whistle-blower system that allows workers to report violations of its rules, though labor lawyers said that it has historically tended to not have enough inspectors.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read the full COVID-19 Vaccination and Testing; Emergency Temporary Standard</strong></em></p>
<p> A Rule by the Labor Department, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration</p>
<p><strong>(a) Purpose:</strong> This section is intended to establish minimum vaccination, vaccination verification, face covering, and testing requirements to address the grave danger of COVID-19 in the workplace, and to preempt inconsistent state and local requirements relating to these issues, including requirements that ban or limit employers’ authority to require vaccination, face covering, or testing, regardless of the number of employees.</p>
<p> <strong><em>Note 1 to paragraph (a):</em></strong><br> This section establishes minimum requirements that employers must implement. Nothing in this section prevents employers from agreeing with workers and their representatives to additional measures not required by this section and this section does not supplant collective bargaining agreements or other collectively negotiated agreements in effect that may have negotiated terms that exceed the requirements herein. The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (NLRA) protects the right of most private-sector employees to take collective action to improve their wages and working conditions.</p>
<strong>(b) Scope and application:</strong><br>
(1) This section covers all employers with a total of 100 or more employees at any time this section is in effect.<p></p>
<p>(2) The requirements of this section do not apply to:<br>
(i) Workplaces covered under the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force COVID-19 Workplace Safety: Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors; or<br>
(ii) Settings where any employee provides healthcare services or healthcare support services when subject to the requirements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-29/subtitle-B/chapter-XVII/part-1910/subpart-U/section-1910.502" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> § 1910.502. </a></p>
<p>(3) The requirements of this section do not apply to the employees of covered employers:<br>
(i) Who do not report to a workplace where other individuals such as coworkers or customers are present;<br>
(ii) While working from home; or<br>
(iii) Who work exclusively outdoors.</p>
<p><strong>(c) Definitions:</strong> The following definitions apply to this section.</p>
<p><em><strong>Assistant Secretary</strong></em> means the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, or designee.</p>
<p><em><strong>COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019)</strong> </em>means the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). For clarity and ease of reference, this section also uses the term “COVID-19” when describing exposures or potential exposures to SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p><em><strong>COVID-19 test</strong></em> means a test for SARS-CoV-2 that is:<br> (i) Cleared, approved, or authorized, including in an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), by the FDA to detect current infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (e.g., a viral test);<br> (ii) Administered in accordance with the authorized instructions; and<br> (iii) Not both self-administered and self-read unless observed by the employer or an authorized telehealth proctor. Examples of tests that satisfy this requirement include tests with specimens that are processed by a laboratory (including home or on-site collected specimens which are processed either individually or as pooled specimens), proctored over-the-counter tests, point of care tests, and tests where specimen collection and processing is either done or observed by an employer.</p>
<p><em><strong>Face covering</strong> </em>means a covering that:<br> (i) (A) completely covers the nose and mouth;</p>
<p>(B) Is made with two or more layers of a breathable fabric that is tightly woven (i.e., fabrics that do not let light pass through when held up to a light source);</p>
<p>(C) Is secured to the head with ties, ear loops, or elastic bands that go behind the head. If gaiters are worn, they should have two layers of fabric or be folded to make two layers;</p>
<p>(D) Fits snugly over the nose, mouth, and chin with no large gaps on the outside of the face; and</p>
<p>(E) Is a solid piece of material without slits, exhalation valves, visible holes, punctures, or other openings.</p>
<p>(ii) This definition includes clear face coverings or cloth face coverings with a clear plastic panel that, despite the non-cloth material allowing light to pass through, otherwise meet this definition and which may be used to facilitate communication with people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing or others who need to see a speaker’s mouth or facial expressions to understand speech or sign language respectively.</p>
<p><em><strong>Facemask</strong> </em>means a surgical, medical procedure, dental, or isolation mask that is FDA-cleared, authorized by an FDA EUA, or offered or distributed as described in an FDA enforcement policy. Facemasks may also be referred to as “medical procedure masks.”</p>
<p><strong><em>Fully vaccinated means:</em></strong><br> (i) A person’s status 2 weeks after completing primary vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine with, if applicable, at least the minimum recommended interval between doses in accordance with the approval, authorization, or listing that is:</p>
<p>(A) Approved or authorized for emergency use by the FDA;</p>
<strong>(j) Information provided to employees:</strong> The employer must inform each employee, in a language and at a literacy level the employee understands, about:<p></p>
