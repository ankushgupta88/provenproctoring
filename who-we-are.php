          <p>The idea for PROVEN started in March of 2020. It was a service designed by Flexefits, a benefit company that was started in 2014 in NJ. At the time we were arranging for testing using PCR tests, mostly for small business groups, in NJ. In March of 2020, we thought, as did many, that COVID-19 was going to go away in the summer months and life would return. We started building platforms to track COVID-19 Testing for businesses as a return-to-work strategy, COVID-19 did not go away, the market went into a chaotic state, and we shelved the whole solution.</p>
		  <p>In June of 2021, we launched the <a href="https://provenpass.com/">ProvenPass.com</a> website with our legacy solution as a web app. We partnered with AccessDX, a CLIA approved lab in houston.</p>
          <p>We have a strong roster of clients across both the AccessDX and the homegrown sales. Additionally, PROVEN was asked to work with Visit Mexico in June of 2021 to develop solutions for COVID-19 to ensure tourism growth and safe travel. We designed a travel kit that includes two Rapid COVID-19 Tests, a PROVEN Pass App to hold vaccine and testing information, clinicians to validate the tests for travel, and some extras to help make travel safer.</p>
		  <p>Today PROVEN provides the most comprehensive fully integrated COVID-19 health solution, including vaccine credential authentication, dedicated testing inventory with delivery support, real-time compliance reporting, and outbreak alerts.</p>
